✅ APPOINTMENTS ERROR - FIXED!

ISSUE: "Error fetching appointments" - Appointments not displaying after booking

ROOT CAUSE:
- Appointment model referenced 'Therapist' instead of 'TherapistAuth'
- Line 11 in /server/models/Appointment.js had wrong ref

FIX APPLIED:
1. Changed therapistId ref from 'Therapist' to 'TherapistAuth' in Appointment.js
2. Updated populate fields in appointment.js to match TherapistAuth schema
3. Moved DELETE /clear-past route before /:id route for proper routing

FILES CHANGED:
✅ /server/models/Appointment.js - Line 11: ref: 'TherapistAuth'
✅ /server/routes/appointment.js - Line 71: populate with correct fields
✅ /server/routes/appointment.js - Line 127: Moved clear-past route

WHAT THIS FIXES:
✅ GET /api/appointments now works correctly
✅ Appointments display in frontend after booking
✅ Populate therapistId works with TherapistAuth model
✅ All appointment routes work correctly

RESTART BACKEND TO APPLY:
cd server
npm start

THEN TEST:
1. Book a session as teen
2. Navigate to Appointments page
3. Should see your booked session with countdown timer
