Three actors interact with the system: Unregistered Users can register and login; Users (Teens) access comprehensive mental health features including mood tracking with AI suggestions, journaling with search and favorites, productivity tools (todos and study plans), AI chatbot support via Botpress, educational resources (videos, music, games), and professional therapy services through instant booking with payment, video sessions via Jitsi, and post-session reviews; Therapists manage their profiles, set pricing, create availability slots, conduct video sessions, and view user reviews. The system automates processes like generating meeting links, enforcing 5-minute wait periods, providing AI-driven suggestions, and managing appointment slots."
